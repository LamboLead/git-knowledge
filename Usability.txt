--- UNDOING CHANGES ---

Undoing the last commit: The working directory is reverted to the last commit, reverted changes are staged, and Git will open text editor to modify the last commited message
    git commit --amend

Undoing uncommited changes: Undoes changes on the staging area and the working directory
    git reset

Do not use git reset on a public repository because other developers may rely on the commit you deleted with this command. Instead, use git revert.

Undoing git rm: Reverts the current staging area and working directory back to the HEAD commit.
    git reset HEAD
    git checkout .

Do not use git commit --amend in public repositories.
