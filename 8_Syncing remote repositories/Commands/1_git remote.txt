--- THE 'origin' REMOTE REPOSITORY
    By executing 'git clone', you will automatically create a remote connection called 'origin', that points back to the cloned repository.
    Creating a local copy of the central directory is an easy method for pulling upstream modifications or publishing local commits. That is why the central repository of many Git-based projects is called 'origin'.
