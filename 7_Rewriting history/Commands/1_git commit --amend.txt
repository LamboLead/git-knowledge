$ git commit --amend ...

While working with Git, you can often forget to format the commit or stage a file. It replaces the current commit entirely by combining staged changes with the previous commit instead of having to create a new one.

--- OPTIONS
    none
        Modifies the commit and opens the text editor to modify the previous commit message.

    -m "commit_message"
        Modifies the commit and updates the commit message of the previous commit with the specified message.

    --no-edit
        Modifies the commit but doesn't change its commit message.

--- NOTES
    The previous commit will not be removed from the current branch. That's why you shouldnt amend a commit which is being developed by other team members in a public repository.
