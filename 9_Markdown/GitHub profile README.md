## Skillset

I consider myself a *constant learner*, specially on the software front. That's why my skillset is constantly morphing.

* **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla Javascript ES6** (Front-End web development)
* **PHP** (Back-End web development)
* **SQL databases**
* **VBA for applications** (Task automation on Excel)
* **Python** (File management & web scraping)
* **Git & Git-flow**


### Currently studying:

* [**Front-End Development Libraries**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/#react) (Bootstrap, JQuery, React, Sass...) on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).
* Some MarkDown to create beautiful README files.
