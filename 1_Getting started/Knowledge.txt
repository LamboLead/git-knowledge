--- GIT'S THREE TREES

    Git works with three environments:

    Working directory
        Represents the files on the file system of the computer that are available to the code editor for applying changes.

    Staging area
        It tracks the changes that took place in the working directory, and that are ready to commit.

    Commit history
        Saves permanent snapshots of the changes placed on the staging area.
