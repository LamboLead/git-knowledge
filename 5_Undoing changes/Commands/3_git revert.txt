$ git revert ...

Creates a new commit in which the commit history is reverted to the specified commit.
It is a safer operation than 'git reset' because it doesn't delete commits.

--- OPTIONS
    
    -e
        Default. Opens the text editor and prompts you to edit the commit message before committing the revert.

    --no-edit
        It doesn't open the text editor.

    -n
        Adds the inverse modifications to the staging area and working directory instead of creating a new commit with the reversed history.
