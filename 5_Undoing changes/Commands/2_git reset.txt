$ git reset ...

Command used to undo changes. It operates in the commit history, the staging area, and the working directory (depending on the way it's invoked).

'git reset' has some similarities with 'git checkout', as they both operate on HEAD:
    'git checkout' moves the HEAD pointer to the specified commit, and the repository enters the state 'Detached HEAD'.
    'git reset' command switches both HEAD and branch references to the defined commit, changing the state of the three trees as well (working directory, staging area, and commit history).

The three options below '--soft', '--mixed', and '--hard' define the modification of the staging area and working directory.

--- OPTIONS

    (If no commits are specified, the commit is the one that HEAD is pointing to)

    --mixed <commit_ID>
        Same as none. The staging area is reset and the pending changes from the staging area are placed in the working directory. It doesn't affect the commit history

    --hard <commit_ID>
        The commit history will be reset to the stated commit, and any work done down the commit history will be lost. The staging index and the working directory are reset.

    --soft <commit_ID>
        Resets the commit history to the specified commit, and any work done down the commit history will be lost. It doesn't affect the staging area or working directory.
