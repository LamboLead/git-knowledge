*  Modify the previous commit
    If you want to modify the message or the files of the previous commit, use:
      $ git commit --amend

    - Change the last commit's message
      
      If you don't want to open the code editor, run:

        $ git commit --amend -m "Your new message"

      This changes the last commit's message with the new one.

    - Modify the last commit's files

      First, you need to add all the changes that you want to insert to the previous commit into the staging area.
      Then, run:

        $git commit --amend --no-edit

      This will change the files of the last commit, adding the new file, and leaving the message untouched.

    If you want to modify a commit further down the commit history, use:
      $git rebase ...
