--- Git URLs

Git URLs are used for transferring remote repository locations to Git commands.

    Protocols

    - Git: Provides a similar service as SSH but without any authentication. It is fast while transferring.
        git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/

    - SSH: Secure Shell Host is a network protocol, which helps to login from one computer to another securely. It has easy configuration, secure access, and data compression before its transfer. It doesn't support anonymous access to the Git repository.
        git clone ssh://user@server/project.git

    - HTTPS: HyperText Transfer Protocol. It is simple, light, and secure because it encrypts the content. However, it's inneficient for the client because it takes a lot of time to clone or fetch from the repository.
        git clone http://example.com/gitproject.git

    - Local: Basic protocol in which the remote repository is in another directory on disk. The path to the repository can be used as the URL for cloning a repository.
        git clone /opt/git/project.git
