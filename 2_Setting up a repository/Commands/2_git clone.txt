git clone ...

Creates a clone/copy of an existing repository into a new directory. Also used to create remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository. It's the most common command which allows users to obtain a development copy of an existing central repository.

--- OPTIONS

    <repository_url> <local_path>
        Clones a repository into the specified path on the local machine.

    --branch <branch_name> <repository_url>
        Specifies a branch which should be cloned instead of the one the remote HEAD pointer is indicating to, usually the master branch.

    --branch <tag> <repository_url>
        Clones only the specified tag from the specified repository.
        
    --bare
        Creates a copy of the remote repository without working directory.

    --mirror
        Inherits the behavior of the --bare argument and clones all the extended references of the remote repository, also allowing to maintain a remote branch tracking configuration.

--- EXAMPLES

    Obtain a local copy of a repository stored on a server using the SSH username "x_person" accessible at "example.com"
    
        git clone ssh://x_person@example.com/path/to/team-project.git
        cd team-project
