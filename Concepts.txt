Version Control System - Source Code Management
Types:
- Local Version Control Systems (local files database)
- Centralized Version Control Systems (single server accessed by different clients)
- Distributed Version Control Systems (clients fully mirror the repository and its full history)

Benefits:
- Long-term change history, that allows going back through versions.
- Branching and merging, to work independently and bring the work together when needed (and analyse conflicts between works).
- Traceability of each change and ability to make an annotation of it with a message describing its purpose.

Best practices
- Commit frequently to go back and undo the work if necessary. Various commits can be combined into a single commit.
- Pull or fetch the latest code before updating to avoid merging conflicts.
- Write detailed notes about the changes you make to appear in the log.
- Review changes in the staging area before creating a snapshot.
- Use branches for the team to work on a separate line of development. When a branch is ready, it can be merged into the master branch.
- Set up a workflow and follow it when making changes to the code. Have shared patterns of collaboration on your team.

SSH Keys

Access credentials used in SSH protocol (Secure Shell). Helps to login from one computer to another securely.
They always come in pairs, composed of a public key and a private key:
- Public/authorized keys determine who can access each system.
- Private/identity keys identify users and give them access.
